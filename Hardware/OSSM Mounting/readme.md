# Mounting Options

There are several options for mounting your OSSM! You will find descriptions of the mounts below, and the files and instructions on how to build them in the folders above. 

The **ball head mount** is the "official" design and is available to [purchase from Research and Desire](https://shop.researchanddesire.com/collections/all/products/ossm-basic-mount). It is mostly 3D printed and is screwed down to a piece of wood. It articulates with a tripod ball head. The parts are easy to get, this is one of the less expensive options. Picture below.

The **Shicks 4040 mount** was created by discord community member Shicks101 (Thanks!) and is made out of Aluminum Extrusion and 3D printed parts. It supports a high level of articulation and variability in height. The parts are easy to get, but it is a little more costly. You may need to weigh it down with dumbbells or sandbags. Picture below.

**Emma's mod** is for the use of a long Nema23. This mount is mostly 3D printed and was created for a different machine, but will still work. (no photo available)  


There are a few more mounting options created by community members in the Discord that are not present here in the repository. Some are motorized! Or if none of these fit your use case, you could create your own and share it with the community.

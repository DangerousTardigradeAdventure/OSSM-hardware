#Mounting Options

There are several options for mounting your OSSM! You will find the files and instructions in the folders above.

The ball head mount is the "official" design and is available to [purchase from Research and Desire](https://shop.researchanddesire.com/collections/all/products/ossm-basic-mount). It is mostly 3D printed and is screwed down to a piece of wood. It articulates with a tripod ball head. The parts are easy to get, this is one of the less expensive options.  


The Shicks 4040 mount was created by discord community member Shicks101 (Thanks!) and is made out of Aluminum Extrusion and printed parts. It supports a high level of articulation and variability in height. The parts are easy to get, but it is a little more costly.  


Emma's mod is for the use of a long Nema23. This mount is mostly 3D printed.

There are a few more mounting options created by community members in the Discord that are not present here in the repository. Or, you could create your own and share it with us!
